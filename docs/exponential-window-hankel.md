# The exponential defect window and the contiguous Hankel bridge

**Status: PROVED.** This note closes issue #2's exponential-window implication.
It does not solve the PV problem with merely vanishing approximation error or
subexponential defect saving. The withdrawn limsup-concavity argument is not
used.

## 1. Statement and standing data

Let `(a_n)` be an integer sequence that is positive on a tail, and suppose

\[
r_n:=\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\longrightarrow\alpha>1,
\qquad c_n:=a_na_{n+2}-a_{n+1}^2,
\qquad |c_n|=O(\alpha^{\gamma n}),\quad\gamma<1.
\tag{1}
\]

No lower Hankel determinant, gcd condition, nearest-integer rule, or
genericity assumption is imposed. Eventual negative sign can be handled by
replacing `a_n` with `-a_n`. The ratio-limit hypothesis can also be replaced
by `a_n>0` eventually and `a_n^{1/n}->alpha>1`; see the end of Section 2.

Put

\[
\rho=\alpha^{\gamma-1}<1,\qquad
D_k(n)=\det(a_{n+i+j})_{0\le i,j<k},\qquad D_0(n)=1.
\]

**Theorem (PV-H3 / PV-EXP-WINDOW).** There is a constant `lambda>0` such that

\[
a_n=\lambda\alpha^n+O(\rho^n).
\tag{2}
\]

For every fixed integer `k>=2`,

\[
D_k(n)=O\!\left(\alpha^{[1-(k-1)(1-\gamma)]n}\right).
\tag{3}
\]

Consequently `D_k(n)=0` for every sufficiently large `n` whenever

\[
\boxed{(k-1)(1-\gamma)>1.}
\tag{4}
\]

The least integer size guaranteed by this estimate is

\[
\boxed{k_{\min}=\left\lfloor\frac1{1-\gamma}\right\rfloor+2.}
\tag{5}
\]

The sequence satisfies a constant-coefficient rational tail recurrence of
order `r<k_min`; its infinite tail Hankel matrix has rank `r`. Moreover the
minimal monic recurrence polynomial is in `Z[X]`, is the minimal polynomial
of `alpha`, and all conjugates of `alpha` other than `alpha` have modulus at
most `rho<1`. In particular `alpha` is Pisot, with

\[
[\mathbb Q(\alpha):\mathbb Q]=r
\le\left\lfloor\frac1{1-\gamma}\right\rfloor+1,
\qquad \lambda\in\mathbb Q(\alpha).
\tag{6}
\]

The recurrence bridge is proved in Section 4 for the exact family in (3):
one **fixed size, all sufficiently large starting indices**. It is not an
appeal to a theorem about only leading determinants of increasing sizes.

## 2. Ratio summation without assuming growth comparability

The exact identity is

\[
r_{n+1}-r_n=\frac{c_n}{a_na_{n+1}}.
\tag{7}
\]

First choose `b` with `max(1,alpha^(gamma/2))<b<alpha`. This is possible
because `gamma<1`. The ratio limit implies `a_n>=C b^n` on a tail for some
`C>0`. Hence, with `q=alpha^gamma/b^2<1`,

\[
|r_{n+1}-r_n|=O(q^n),\qquad
r_n-\alpha=-\sum_{j=n}^{\infty}(r_{j+1}-r_j)=O(q^n).
\tag{8}
\]

In particular `sum |r_n/alpha-1|<infinity`. The positive infinite product
converges to a finite nonzero limit:

\[
\frac{a_n}{\alpha^n}
=\frac{a_N}{\alpha^N}\prod_{j=N}^{n-1}\frac{r_j}{\alpha}
\longrightarrow\lambda>0.
\tag{9}
\]

This establishes `a_n asymp alpha^n`; it was not assumed when deriving (8).
Return to (7) with this stronger comparison. For
`tau=alpha^(gamma-2)<1`, we now obtain

\[
r_{n+1}-r_n=O(\tau^n),\qquad r_n-\alpha=O(\tau^n).
\tag{10}
\]

Taking the tail of the logarithm of (9) gives

\[
\log\frac{a_n}{\lambda\alpha^n}
=-\sum_{j=n}^{\infty}\log\frac{r_j}{\alpha}
=O(\tau^n).
\tag{11}
\]

Exponentiation proves
`a_n-lambda alpha^n=O(alpha^n tau^n)=O(rho^n)`, as asserted.
If the defect hypothesis is little-o instead of big-O, the sharpened
geometric tail sums in (10)-(11) are little-o as well, and the error in (2)
is `o(rho^n)`.

If only the positive root-growth limit is assumed, it still yields
`a_n>=C b^n` with the same choice of `b`. Absolute convergence in (7) first
gives a finite limit `L>=0` for `r_n`. The possibility `L=0` would force
`a_n^{1/n}->0`: for every `epsilon>0` all late ratios would be at most
`epsilon`. For `L>0`, the Cesaro average of `log r_n` shows that the
root-growth limit is `L`. Thus `L=alpha`, and the preceding proof applies.

## 3. Rank-one estimate and every threshold case

For fixed `k`, write the actual contiguous Hankel matrix as

\[
H_k(n)=\lambda\alpha^n u v^T+E_k(n),\qquad
u_i=\alpha^i,\quad v_j=\alpha^j,\quad
(E_k(n))_{ij}=e_{n+i+j}.
\tag{12}
\]

Each main column is `O(alpha^n)` and each error column is `O(rho^n)`.
The constants may depend on the fixed size `k`. Expand the determinant
multilinearly in its columns. Every term with two main columns is zero,
since those columns are proportional. The surviving terms therefore have
either one main column and `k-1` error columns, or `k` error columns.
The Leibniz formula, or Hadamard's inequality, yields

\[
|D_k(n)|\le C_k\alpha^n\rho^{(k-1)n}+C'_k\rho^{kn}.
\tag{13}
\]

The second term is bounded by a constant times the first, since
`rho/alpha<1`. This proves (3). Under (4) the right side tends to zero;
`D_k(n)` is an integer, so it vanishes for **all** late `n`.

| Defect exponent | Smallest size from (13) | Boundary treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `gamma<0` | `2` | The integer defect itself is eventually zero. |
| `gamma=0` | `3` | Size `2` is only bounded, and can remain nonzero. |
| `0<gamma<1`, `1/(1-gamma)` not an integer | `floor(1/(1-gamma))+2` | Strict inequality (4). |
| `gamma=1-1/m`, integer `m>=1` | `m+2` | Size `m+1` gives only `O(1)`. |
| Same reciprocal-integer case with `c_n=o(alpha^(gamma n))` | `m+1` | Now (13) is `o(1)`; integrality does give vanishing. |
| `gamma=1` | No size guaranteed | There is no decaying error in (2). |

The floor in (5) is intentional. Replacing it by
`ceil(1/(1-gamma))+1` loses the strict inequality precisely at reciprocal
integers. The estimate is sharp as a rank-one perturbation estimate; it
does not assert that every integer sequence has the maximal allowed rank.

**Integer boundary controls.** The Lucas sequence
`L_0=2, L_1=1, L_(n+2)=L_(n+1)+L_n` has
`alpha=(1+sqrt(5))/2`, error `(-1/alpha)^n`, and
`D_2(n)=5(-1)^n`. It satisfies the `gamma=0` defect bound, but its size-2
layer never vanishes.

For `gamma=1/2`, use the power traces of `f(X)=X^3-3X^2-1`:

\[
a_0=3,\quad a_1=3,\quad a_2=9,\qquad
a_{n+3}=3a_{n+2}+a_n.
\tag{14}
\]

The polynomial has one real root `alpha>3`: both stationary values, at
`0` and `2`, are negative. Its other roots are a complex-conjugate pair,
their product is `1/alpha`, and their common modulus is `alpha^(-1/2)`.
Thus (2) holds with `lambda=1` and `rho=alpha^(-1/2)`. Direct expansion of
the defect gives `c_n=O((alpha rho)^n)=O(alpha^(n/2))`.
The Vandermonde factorization of the trace Hankel matrix gives

\[
D_3(n)=\operatorname{disc}(f)(\alpha\beta\bar\beta)^n
=-135\ne0,\qquad D_4(n)=0.
\tag{15}
\]

These examples satisfy the integer and expanding hypotheses, and rule out
turning the equality case of (4) into a vanishing assertion.

For every integer `m>=1`, a rational boundary control for the estimate is

\[
b_n=2^{mn}+m\,2^{-n}\mathbf1_{m\mid n}.
\tag{16}
\]

It is the sum of the powers of `alpha=2^m` and of the `m` distinct numbers
`beta_j=(1/2) exp(2 pi i j/m)`. The latter sum is exactly the rational
second term of (16). With `gamma=1-1/m`, Vandermonde factorization gives
`D_(m+1)(n)=D_(m+1)(0)(-1)^((m-1)n)` with nonzero initial determinant,
while the next layer vanishes. These rational examples show sharpness of
the estimate for every reciprocal integer; they are not used as integer
counterexamples or to apply the integrality step.

At `gamma=1`, choose any transcendental `alpha>1` and
`a_n=floor(alpha^n)`. Then the ratios tend to `alpha`, the error is `O(1)`,
and expansion shows `c_n=O(alpha^n)`. A rational tail recurrence would,
after division by `a_n` and taking limits, give a nonzero polynomial over
`Q` vanishing at `alpha`, a contradiction. Thus the strict hypothesis
`gamma<1` cannot simply be dropped.

## 4. A bridge with exactly the contiguous-layer hypothesis

**Theorem (PV-HANKEL-RANK-BRIDGE).** Let `(a_n)` be a sequence over any
field `F`. If for some fixed `K>=1` and `N`,

\[
D_K(n)=0\quad\text{for every }n\ge N,
\tag{17}
\]

then there exist `M` with `N<=M<=N+K-1` and an order `0<=r<K` such that
the tail has a constant-coefficient recurrence

\[
a_{n+r}=\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}q_j a_{n+j}\quad(n\ge M),\qquad q_j\in F.
\tag{18}
\]

Order zero means `a_n=0` for every `n>=M`. For a nonzero tail, the order
can be chosen minimal and satisfies `D_r(n)!=0` for every `n>=M`.
The infinite matrix `(a_(M+i+j))_(i,j>=0)` then has rank exactly `r`.

**Proof: descent supplies the nonvanishing.** Desnanot-Jacobi, with the
empty determinant equal to one, is the polynomial identity

\[
D_{s+1}(n)D_{s-1}(n+2)
=D_s(n)D_s(n+2)-D_s(n+1)^2\quad(s\ge1).
\tag{19}
\]

For completeness, (19) does not require an invertible inner block. With
indeterminate entries, take the inner `(s-1)`-square block `B` and move the
two boundary rows and columns last. Its two-by-two Schur complement `S`
gives `det(H_(s+1))=det(B) det(S)`. The diagonal entries multiplied by
`det(B)` are `D_s(n)` and `D_s(n+2)`, and each off-diagonal entry multiplied
by `det(B)` is `(-1)^(s-1) D_s(n+1)`. Multiplying the Schur determinant by
`det(B)` proves (19) in the generic case. Clearing denominators makes this
an identity of polynomials over `Z`, valid under every specialization,
including `det(B)=0` and in any characteristic. For `s=1`, it is simply
the two-by-two determinant formula with the empty block determinant one.

Suppose `D_(s+1)(n)=0` for every `n>=T`. The lower layer
`x_n=D_s(n)` therefore obeys

\[
x_nx_{n+2}=x_{n+1}^2\quad(n\ge T).
\tag{20}
\]

If `x_(T+1)=0`, (20) at `T+1` implies `x_(T+2)=0`, and induction makes
the whole lower layer zero from `T+1` onward. Descend one size and advance
the starting index by one. If `x_(T+1)!=0`, (20) at `T` implies both
`x_T!=0` and `x_(T+2)!=0`; subsequent applications make every `x_n`
nonzero for `n>=T`. Stop with `r=s` and `M=T`. Starting from `(K,N)`,
this either stops at a positive order, or descends to `D_1(n)=a_n=0`
on a tail. There are at most `K-1` advances. This proves the asserted
bound on `M` and includes singular layers and the eventually zero tail.

**Proof: overlapping windows make the coefficients constant.** In the
nonzero case, `D_(r+1)(n)=0` and `D_r(n)!=0` for every `n>=M`.
For each such `n` the first `r` equations

\[
a_{n+i+r}=\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}q_j(n)a_{n+i+j}
\quad(0\le i<r)
\tag{21}
\]

have a unique solution, by invertibility of `H_r(n)`. Subtract that
linear combination from the last column of `H_(r+1)(n)`. Its first `r`
entries become zero. Expanding along that column yields

\[
0=D_{r+1}(n)=D_r(n)
\left(a_{n+2r}-\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}q_j(n)a_{n+r+j}\right).
\tag{22}
\]

The final residual is zero. Equations (21)-(22) with `i=1,...,r` are
exactly the `r` equations defining `q(n+1)`. Their solution is unique,
so `q(n+1)=q(n)` on the whole tail. This proves (18).

Let `C_j=(a_(M+i+j))_(i>=0)` be the infinite Hankel columns. Equation
(18), for every row index, expresses each `C_(j+r)` using the preceding
`r` columns. Thus the rank is at most `r`. The minor `D_r(M)!=0` makes
the first `r` columns independent, so the rank is exactly `r`, and no
smaller tail recurrence can exist. This finishes the proof. There was no
division by a lower minor until its nonvanishing had been established.

**Why every late shift matters.** For the integer sequence
`a_(2j)=0, a_(2j+1)=2^(j^2)`, all size-3 minors starting at even indices
vanish, but

\[
D_3(2j+1)=b_{j+1}(b_jb_{j+2}-b_{j+1}^2)\ne0,
\quad b_j=2^{j^2}.
\tag{23}
\]

Its superexponential subsequence rules out any constant-coefficient
recurrence: such recurrences have at most exponential growth, as follows
by bounding their finite-dimensional companion matrix powers. Thus one
vanishing moving minor, a sparse set of shifts, or an arbitrary finite
prefix does not supply (17).

## 5. The algebraic and Pisot endpoints

Apply Section 4 over `Q` after the integer vanishing step. The tail is
nonzero because it is expanding, so `1<=r<k_min`. Dividing (18) by `a_n`
and using the ratio limit gives

\[
p(\alpha)=0,\qquad
p(X)=X^r-\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}q_jX^j\in\mathbb Q[X].
\tag{24}
\]

This already closes the rational-recurrence-to-algebraicity implication.
The following argument also proves the stronger assertions in (6), without
importing an integer-series rationality theorem.

Let `V=span_Q{C_j:j>=0}`, of dimension `r`, and let `S` be the shift
`(x_0,x_1,...)->(x_1,x_2,...)`. It maps `C_j` to `C_(j+1)` and preserves
`V`. Projection to the first `r` coordinates is injective on `V`, because
its matrix on `C_0,...,C_(r-1)` has determinant `D_r(M)!=0`.
The group `L=sum_(j>=0) Z C_j` therefore embeds in `Z^r`. It is a finitely
generated free abelian group of rank `r`, spans `V`, and satisfies
`S(L) subset L`. In a `Z`-basis of `L`, `S` has an integer matrix `T`.
Cayley-Hamilton gives a monic integer annihilating polynomial of degree
`r`. The recurrence in (18) has minimal order `r`, so this characteristic
polynomial must be `p`. Hence `p in Z[X]`.

Also `q_0!=0`: replacing the last column by (18) gives

\[
D_r(n+1)=(-1)^{r-1}q_0D_r(n),
\tag{25}
\]

and both determinants are nonzero. Thus `p(0)!=0`.

The tail generating series is a rational function over `Q`. Its reduced
denominator is `z^r p(1/z)`, normalized to have constant term one; a
cancellation would lower the recurrence order. On the other hand, (2)
gives the meromorphic representation

\[
\sum_{j\ge0}a_{M+j}z^j
=\frac{\lambda\alpha^M}{1-\alpha z}
 +\sum_{j\ge0}e_{M+j}z^j,
\tag{26}
\]

where the second series is analytic for `|z|<1/rho`. In this disk the
only pole is the simple pole at `1/alpha`. Therefore `alpha` is a simple
root of `p`, and all other roots of `p` have modulus at most `rho<1`.

The irreducible monic integer factor containing `alpha` is its minimal
polynomial. Any remaining monic integer factor of `p` would have only
roots of modulus less than one and a nonzero constant term. The absolute
value of that integer constant term would be a product strictly less
than one, which is impossible. Thus `p` itself is the minimal polynomial
of `alpha`: `alpha` is Pisot and `r` is its degree. The coefficient of
the simple pole in the rational function (26) lies in `Q(alpha)`;
dividing by `alpha^M` proves `lambda in Q(alpha)`.

## 6. Evidence, provenance, and remaining scope

The general proofs above are the basis for promotion. Exact finite
regressions in `tests/test_hankel.py` check the ratio identity,
Desnanot-Jacobi in singular and signed cases, rank-one multilinearity,
the threshold floor, both integer boundary examples, rational boundary
examples, overlapping recurrence windows, descent controls, and the
sparse-shift counterexample. The kernel returns local recurrence candidates
and finite residuals; it does not certify an infinite tail from a prefix.

For background, Aitor Iribar Lopez's *The Carlson-Polya theorem on rational
functions*, Section 2, Theorem 1, states Kronecker's criterion using leading
Hankel determinants of **increasing order**. That formulation is not the
hypothesis obtained here, so Section 4 proves the needed bridge directly:
<https://people.math.ethz.ch/~airibar/Polya_Carlson.pdf>.

Still open: the general PV problem, the subexponential/polynomial defect
frontier, `PV-POLY-EQUIV`, the converse reduction in its generality, and the
broader `PV-SALEM-EXCLUSION` claim with merely vanishing error, plus the
bounded-gcd period-four and coprime-tail programs. This note does not promote
those claims or reuse the withdrawn limsup shortcut.
